•	When Folgers offered a trade deal (first image), brand profit increased sharply to $53,507, and coffee category profit rose to $53,536.
•	Without the trade deal (second image), Folgers' profit dropped to $18,762, and category profit fell significantly to $18,838.
•	The trade deal lowered Folgers’ wholesale price ($3.14 vs. $3.64), increasing retailer margin and driving up demand (78,362 vs. 58,496 units).
•	Despite the lower shelf price with the trade deal, the unit margin increases from $0.85 (without a trade deal) to $1.35 (with trade deal) due to the reduced wholesale cost.
•	 This higher margin combined with increased volume significantly boosts total profits, making the trade deal highly beneficial.
•	Maxwell and Starbucks remained largely unaffected in both scenarios, with minimal demand and negligible contributions to category profit.
•	This suggests Folgers dominates customer choice, and promotional decisions around it have the most significant impact on overall category performance.
## Conclusion:
Offering the trade deal from Folgers to Jewel-Osco is a profitable strategy. It not only maximizes Folgers’ profit but also drives overall category growth, with little cannibalization or shift in demand toward competitors.
