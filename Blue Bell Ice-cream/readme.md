## Introduction
Blue Bell Creameries have grown significantly, expanding beyond Brenham to major Texas cities. However, North Texas sales territories have become imbalanced, leading to quota challenges and high turnover. Sales manager Ryan Mullen aims to redesign territories using data from 50 counties to ensure fair distribution and efficiency. 
## Technologies
Excel, Solver
## Objective
The primary objective of this study is to develop an optimized territory design strategy for Blue Bell Ice Cream’s North Texas region. Additionally, we will assess whether the current territory centers (Moore, Donley, and Briscoe) are optimal or if alternative locations could better balance workload and travel costs.
## Insights:
We analyzed the distance of each county from the HQ and used Solver to determine the optimal location. The selected HQ minimizes total costs while ensuring efficient territory distribution.

1.	Optimization Outcome: By leveraging Solver and macros, we identified Montague County (47) as a more optimal territory center instead of Briscoe County (24), leading to improved workload distribution and efficiency.
2.	Cost Reduction: The optimized solution significantly lowers the total cost from $2,913,708 (base case) to $1,976,515, resulting in savings of $937,192 (a 32% reduction).
3.	Balanced Workload: The new configuration reduces excessive travel requirements, ensuring that sales representatives have more manageable territories, addressing concerns of unfair workload distribution.
4.	Strategic Adjustment: The originally proposed centers (Moore, Donley, and Briscoe Counties) resulted in higher operational costs, making the new selection (Moore, Donley, and Montague Counties) a more effective alternative.
## Conclusion:
Reassigning the third territory center to Montague County (47) effectively minimizes travel costs and balances sales potential across territories. This strategic realignment optimizes efficiency, reduces operational expenses, and mitigates salesperson turnover risk. By implementing a data-driven approach, Blue Bell Creameries can enhance its North Texas sales operations, ensuring a fair and sustainable sales strategy.
## Recommendations
•	Adopt Moore, Donley, and Montague Counties as territory centers to reduce costs and balance workloads. 
•	Improve logistics with better travel support and optimize sales team retention with fair quotas and incentives.
•	Monitor market shifts to refine territory centers for sustained efficiency.
