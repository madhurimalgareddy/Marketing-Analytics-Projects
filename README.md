## Brand Competetion
Brand competition refers to the rivalry between companies offering similar products or services to the same target audience, striving to gain market share, revenue, and profitability. This project focuses on leading brands like Nestl√© and Novartis as they compete in the Liquid Dietary Supplements (LDS) market. Their strategies involve engaging in price traps and modifying product compositions to outmaneuver each other. This has been an intriguing project, providing me with the opportunity to closely analyze how companies respond to their competitors' strategic changes and tactics.
