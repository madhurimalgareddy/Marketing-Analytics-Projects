# Marketing Analytics Projects
This repository consists of all the Marketing Analytics projects that I have worked through out my course as well as my personal projects.As there are multiple projects in this repository, I have created readme documents for each project separately. Here you can find the introduction to each of those projects. For more detail, please look into the respective project folder.
## Brand Competetion
Brand competition refers to the rivalry between companies offering similar products or services to the same target audience, striving to gain market share, revenue, and profitability. This project focuses on leading brands like Nestl√© and Novartis as they compete in the Liquid Dietary Supplements (LDS) market. Their strategies involve engaging in price traps and modifying product compositions to outmaneuver each other. This has been an intriguing project, providing me with the opportunity to closely analyze how companies respond to their competitors' strategic changes and tactics.
