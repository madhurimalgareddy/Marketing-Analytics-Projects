## Brand Competetion
Brand competition refers to the rivalry between companies or organizations offering similar products or services to the same target audience, aiming to gain market share, revenue, and profits. This project involves Top brands like Nesley and Novartis who compete for their LDS(Liquid dietery supllements) market share,revenue and profit by attacting each other in price traps and also changing their composition elements. This is a very interestng project where i had an opportunity to carefully observe how one company reacts to others changes and tactics.
