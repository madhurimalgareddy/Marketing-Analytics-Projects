## Introduction:
Mod-Choice, Inc., founded in 2005 by Dr. Niladri Siddartha (Dr. Sid) and Chuck "The Grezzer" Grezlak, specializes in advanced statistical software for discrete choice modeling. The software includes four modules—Basic, Advanced, Experiment Designer, and Conjoint—designed for Bayesian Monte Carlo-Markov Chain methods. While the company has used modular pricing, a recent analysis suggests that adopting a bundle pricing strategy could better capture customer willingness to pay and maximize revenue.
## Objective:
The objective of this analysis was to evaluate optimal bundle pricing strategies for the 'Mod-Choice' statistical software, targeting three key customer segments: Corporate, Marketing, and Academic. The goal was to maximize profitability by offering tailored product bundles.
