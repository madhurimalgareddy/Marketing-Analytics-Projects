# Brand Competetion- Nesley v/s Novartis
## LIQUID DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS
Beta- Novartis   
Delta- Nesley
### Introduction
This case study examines the strategic pricing competition between Beta and Delta in a competitive market. Beta, Delta, and Gamma supply Liquid Dietary Supplements (LDS) for patients unable to consume solid food. Variations in LDS composition led to differences in production costs and pricing strategies. Beta employed a tactical pricing approach to pressure Delta into a price trap, ultimately strengthening its market position and profitability. This summary explores the strategic pricing decisions and their impact on market share, revenue, and profit margins.
### Objective
The goal is to analyze how brands compete by adjusting product compositions and pricing in response to competitors’ strategies.
### Observations
We will analyze the following two scenarios
Scenario 1: Beta’s change in calorie density (Price constant)

Initially, Beta held a 35% market share, which dropped to 29% after adjusting calorie density. Delta responded by modifying price and product attributes, causing Beta to regain 33% market share in its final pricing choice. Delta, however, saw its share plummet from 31% to 11%, demonstrating the effectiveness of Beta’s strategy.
From a cost perspective, Beta reduced its unit cost from $37.20 to $29.70, significantly boosting profit margins. Beta’s initial profit of $987K surged approximately to $4M after strategic changes. In contrast, Delta’s profit declined from $5M to $2M, as its reactionary moves led to severe market share losses.
Scenario 2: Beta has altered both calorie density as well as price.

Beta reduced its price to the lowest possible value while also adjusting calorie density. In response, Delta modified two non-price attributes and raised its price to $55, reducing its market share from 31% to 23%. However, Delta lowered its unit cost from $33 to $20.60, projecting $8 million in profit.
Beta countered with its final strategic move, further weakening Delta. As a result, Delta’s market share fell to just 8%, while Beta secured $5 million in profits. Although Beta’s market share remained close to its original level, its profitability soared due to cost reductions from $37.20 to $29.70.
In both scenarios, Delta’s decisions ultimately proved detrimental, as its aggressive price increase and attribute modifications resulted in substantial market share losses and declining profitability.
### Conclusion
By strategically adjusting both pricing and product attributes, Beta outmaneuvered Delta on multiple fronts. The combination of price manipulation and product differentiation allowed Beta to dominate the market, increase profitability, and sustain a competitive edge. This case highlights how multifaceted competitive strategies—beyond just pricing—are essential for long-term market leadership.
